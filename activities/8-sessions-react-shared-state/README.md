# Exercise 8 - Demo and Challenge

This application demonstrates using React's Custom Hooks for sharing state between components in a login / session driven setting.

To get started, install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Then run the app. This will start both the backend express web server and the react local development server.
```
npm run start
```

Note that the `/dashboard` page does not show the content we want it to unless you are logged in.

We will walk through the frontend code that drives it to demonstrate React hooks and shared state.
